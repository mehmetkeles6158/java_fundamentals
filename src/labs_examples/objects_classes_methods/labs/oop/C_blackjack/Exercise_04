Make the BlackJack game we just created better. Add a way for the user and the computer to bet. Give the user and computer
both an initial sum of "money" and let them play with it. Take actual bets. If either user runs out of money, stop the game.
Consistently print out the current amount of money both the user and computer have after each game.

Any additional features you'd like to add? Go for it!


//Example for for exercise-4

// int money;          // Amount of money the user has.
        int bet;            // Amount user bets on a game.

        money = 100;  // User starts with $100.
